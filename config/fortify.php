    // tenancy pipeline, so an unauthenticated request to any tenant route redirects to /login on
    // WHATEVER host it arrived at — including a tenant's custom domain, where the platform's credential
    // form would then render. It allows the central host and its subdomains (tenant users legitimately
    // log in at acme.meridian.test/login) and 404s exactly one class of host: a custom domain.
    // AppSecurityHeaders (I1) is appended for the surface it matters on most: a framed login form is the
    // textbook clickjacking target, and these routes are the only ones in the app that render a credential
    // prompt. See that class for why the guest runtime deliberately makes the opposite choice.
    // GateRegistration (I5 / PRD Feature #10) closes /register when the platform's open-signup toggle is
    // off, or when the tenant whose subdomain the request arrived on is invitation-only. It is appended
    // here because Fortify has no per-route middleware hook — Features::registration() registers both verbs
    // with THIS list — which is exactly why that class checks `$request->is('register')` before it does
    // anything: applied indiscriminately it would 404 /login for everyone.
