# Lane A — active claim

**One writer: Lane A.** Lane B never edits this file, and Lane A never edits `lane-b.md`. That is
what makes a claim conflict structurally impossible rather than merely unlikely.

**The protocol is Standing Rule 7(g)**, not this header. In one line: **a claim is a *pushed*
commit** — write it here, `git push origin HEAD:main`, and only then open the first file. An
unpushed claim does not exist; M14 proved that by writing a perfect one that nobody could see.

**Before opening any shared or paired artefact**, `git fetch` and read both lane files.

Shared artefacts, which are claimed and never owned: `docs/**`, `openapi.json`, `phpunit.xml`,
`PROGRESS.md` (own block only), and the top-level `tests/e2e/*.spec.ts`.
Paired files — where a change obliges you to edit *both* halves in the same PR — are listed in
Standing Rule 7(b-bis).

## Status: NO ACTIVE CLAIM

Lane A holds nothing. The two-lane protocol was established on 2026-08-25 with the board clean —
no open PRs, no commits ahead in any worktree.

## Template

```
## CLAIMED — <row name> (<branch>)
Opened: <date>. Row: <the backlog row, quoted enough to identify it>.
Files: <every file to be edited, repo-relative>.
Shared artefacts taken: <docs/…, openapi.json, … — or "none">.
Paired files taken: <7(b-bis) entries, and the other half of each — or "none">.
Namespaces spent: <migration prefix / ADR number — or "nothing from either namespace">.
Prediction: <what you expect the gates to do, written BEFORE the run so it can be measured
             against rather than explained afterwards>.

## RELEASED — <row name> (merged as PR #<n>, <sha>, 6/6)
<what was actually taken; whether every claimed file was edited; anything the claim was
 extended to mid-build, each of which was its own pushed commit before the file was opened>
```
