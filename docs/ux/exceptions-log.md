# Design System — Exceptions Log

Numbered record of deliberate deviations from `design-system-reference.md`. Per DSR §1.3, any
component/layout that does not use the shared system as-specified must be logged here with what
wasn't used, why, and its intended disposition. Three-plus undocumented deviations for the same
need signal a missing shared component, not acceptable practice.

## #1 — Slim auth-card layout (`resources/js/Layouts/AuthLayout.vue`)

**Introduced:** Phase 0 · Increment C1 (design-system foundation + styled auth flow).

**What deviates:** DSR §3.0 defines exactly two shells — the Authenticated App Shell and the
Public/Guest Runtime Shell — and states "no third variant without a documented exception." The
pre-auth pages (sign in, register, forgot/reset password, confirm password, 2FA challenge, verify
email, invitation accept) use a third, narrower layout: a single centered card on the canvas, with
no top nav, no sidebar, and no tenant/form branding.

**Why:** These are pre-authentication guest surfaces. They have no authenticated user, no tenant
context, no navigation targets, and are intentionally narrower (~400px) than both the admin shell
and the form-runtime shell. Forcing them into either named shell would add empty chrome (a nav with
nothing to navigate to) or the wrong width.

**Disposition:** Classified as a **slim member of the Public/Guest Runtime Shell family**, not a new
top-level shell. It is built entirely from shared design-system tokens (no one-off colors, spacing,
radius, or type). When the public form-runtime shell is built (Phase 1+), this auth layout should be
folded into a shared guest-shell primitive rather than remaining a separate app-level component.
It lives in the app (`resources/js/Layouts/`) rather than the package for now because it is
Inertia-specific and the public-runtime SPA that would share it does not yet exist.
